## Getting started:
```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then you can open the React frontend at localhost:3000 and the RESTful GoLang API at localhost:5000

Changing any frontend (React) code locally will cause a hot-reload in the browser with updates and changing any backend (GoLang) code locally will also automatically update any changes.
